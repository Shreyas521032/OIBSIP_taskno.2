Project Overview
This BMI Calculator is a simple Python application designed for beginners to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-provided weight and height. The program classifies the BMI into predefined health categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese.

Key Concepts and Challenges
User Input Validation
The program ensures valid user inputs within reasonable ranges and gracefully handles errors related to input validation.

BMI Calculation
Accurate implementation of the BMI formula to calculate the Body Mass Index based on user-provided weight and height.

Categorization
Classifying BMI values into health categories based on predefined ranges to provide users with insights into their weight status.

Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bmi-calculator.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd bmi-calculator
Run the program:

bash
Copy code
python bmi_calculator.py
Usage
Enter your weight in kilograms when prompted.
Enter your height in meters when prompted.
The program will calculate your BMI and display the result along with the corresponding health category.
Advanced Features (Optional)
For advanced users, the project can be extended with the following features:

GUI Design: Create an intuitive graphical user interface using a library like Tkinter.
Data Storage: Implement user data storage using file storage or a small database (e.g., SQLite).
Data Visualization: Visualize historical BMI data with graphs or charts using a library like Matplotlib.
Error Handling: Address potential issues with data storage or retrieval to enhance the robustness of the application.
User Experience: Enhance the user interface for a more responsive and user-friendly experience.
