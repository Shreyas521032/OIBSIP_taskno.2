# Basic Weather App

## Brief Description

This is a simple command-line weather application built in Python. It fetches and displays current weather data for a user-specified location, providing information such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. It's designed for beginners looking to practice fundamental concepts like API integration, user input handling, and error management.

## Problem Statement and Key Concepts

### API Integration

The app connects to a weather API to retrieve up-to-date weather information. The API response, usually in JSON format, is then parsed to extract relevant data.

### User Input Handling

The application validates and processes user input for the location, ensuring a smooth user experience. Input can be in the form of a city name or ZIP code.

### Prerequisites

Before running the app, make sure you have:

- Python installed on your machine.
- A valid API key from a weather API provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap). You can obtain a key by signing up on their website.

### Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/basic-weather-app.git
cd basic-weather-app
